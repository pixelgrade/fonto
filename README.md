Fonto â€” Custom Web Fonts Manager
========

## Description

Fonto is a custom fonts management plugin that will seamlessly integrate with the WordPress editor, allowing you to get right to using your fancy free or premium fonts.

It is built to work with pretty much any configuration font vendors offer (like Typekit, Fonts.com, MyFonts.com, Google Fonts), either by allowing them to serve the fonts via an embed code or by self-hosting the font files.

Plus, we've integrated Fonto with our [Customify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customify/) plugin to make it even smoother to control your site's general typography.

### Compatible

Use your premium web fonts directly in the Editor or with the Customify plugin. Works with Typekit, MyFonts, Fonts.com, self-hosted fonts, and others.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I am a developer. Can I easily change how things work?

We are also developers (and designers, and marketers, and support people...) just like you. We know how important it is that plugins get coded in a open, thoughtful manner that is friendly towards those that have custom requirements.

The plugin provides actions and filters in all the right places allowing you introduce custom logic just about anywhere, if the need arises.
