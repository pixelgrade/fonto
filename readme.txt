Fonto allows you to use your favourite premium web fonts into your site, by making them available through the Editor and the Customify plugin. Support premium fonts from Typekit, MyFonts, Fonts.com, Fontspring or even self-hosted.

== Description ==

Fonto is a custom fonts management plugin that will seamlessly integrate with the WordPress editor, allowing you to get right to using your fancy free or premium fonts.

It is built to work with pretty much any configuration font vendors offer (like Typekit, Fonts.com, MyFonts.com, Google Fonts), either by allowing them to serve the fonts via an embed code or by self-hosting the font files.

Plus, we've integrated Fonto with our [Customify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customify/) plugin to make it even smoother to control your site's general typography.
