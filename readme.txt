Use your custom premium web fonts directly in the Editor or with the Customify and Style Manager plugins. Works with Typekit, MyFonts, Fonts.com, self-hosted fonts, and others.

== Description ==

Fonto is a custom fonts management plugin that will seamlessly integrate with the WordPress editor, allowing you to get right to using your fancy free or premium fonts.

It is built to work with pretty much any configuration font vendors offer (like Typekit, Fonts.com, MyFonts.com, Google Fonts), either by allowing them to serve the fonts via an embed code or by self-hosting the font files.

Plus, we've integrated Fonto with our [Customify](https://wordpress.org/plugins/customify/) and [Style Manager](https://wordpress.org/plugins/style-manager/) plugins to make it even smoother to control your site's general typography.
